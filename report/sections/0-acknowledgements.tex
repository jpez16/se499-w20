Thank you to Katherine Lu, Nikola Vasiljevic and Tyler Zhang for bringing me onto their FYDP team given my unusual circumstances. With this document being directly related to our SE491 project, a large portion of the research and information being discussed is a direct result of their time and effort throughout the winter 2020 term.

Thank you to Derek Rayside for motivating us to pursue this project as well as our academics during COVID-19.
